QUANTUS

1.  Setup
    a.  Get battery reading
          i.  Turn on battery LED if level is too low
    b.  Connect to SD card
          i.  If card failed to connect, try for * seconds
    c.  Collect a few sample temperature measurements, take average and
        determine error in measurement
    d.  Compute speed of sound in air for +/- * degrees in 0.* degree intervals
    e.  Compute differentials for linear approximation
    f.  Compute error in speed of sound calculations


2. First loop
  -.  Compute data collection frequency from switches
        -. Blink Status LED yellow in color at data collection frequency
  -.  Check to see if data collection button has been pressed
        -.  If the button has been pressed and the device is in standby
              -> Collect Data
        -.  If the Button has been pressed and the device is in data collection
            mode
              -


  -.  Get data collection frequency from switches
  -.  Loop
  -.  Start timer
  -.  Send pulse through



Options:

- If frequency is small, compute distance-time data immediately
- If frequency is large, write [time, error in time, temperature, error in
  temperature, time taken, and error in time taken] to separate file, then
  compute distance and error in distance
